# Usage

```python
from quickjs import Function

f = Function("f", """
    function adder(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    function f(a, b) {
        return adder(a, b);
    }
    """)

assert f(1, 2) == 3
```

Simple types like int, floats and strings are converted directly. Other types (dicts, lists) are converted via JSON by the `Function` class.
The library is thread-safe if `Function` is used. If the `Context` class is used directly, it can only ever be accessed by the same thread.
This is true even if the accesses are not concurrent.

Both `Function` and `Context` expose `set_memory_limit` and `set_time_limit` functions that allow limits for code running in production.

## API
The `Function` class has, apart from being a callable, additional methods:
- `set_memory_limit`
- `set_time_limit`
- `set_max_stack_size`
- `memory` – returns a dict with information about memory usage.
- `add_callable` – adds a Python function and makes it callable from JS.
- `execute_pending_job` – executes a pending job (such as a async function or Promise).

## Documentation
For full functionality, please see `test_quickjs.py`

# Developing
This project uses a git submodule for the upstream code, so clone it with the `--recurse-submodules` option or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` afterwards.

Use a `poetry shell` and `make test` should work from inside its virtual environment.
